# Neural network in javascript
Before we start talkin about this project, i want to explain some concepts and his differences to myselft here:

### Artificial inteligence
This is a general class, the top level where "smart machines" are. Basically, every machine that does something like a human, or in a smart way can be classified like an Artificial inteligence. 

### Machine learning
I like to think its a subclass of AI. In this class, the machines can learn alone, just give some database to it and after some time it will know to do the task. The opposite is to build a machine that already knows how to do the task.

The main example is like, give a hundred images of cats to the machine and tells that it are cat images. Then, give another hundred of images of dogs to the machine, and tells that are dogs. After it, if you give to the machine a random image of a cat or a dog, probabily the machine will be able to identify what are dog images or cat images.

### Neural network
It is definitively a type of machine learning. Here, the machine has a set of neurons that are able of process the data they receive, like us. The machine learn with the update of this interconections and ties, in a logic way.

### Deep learning
Is another way of organization of the neural network. Here, the neurons are in a hidden layer, below the neural network. It need more processing and hardware to run.


## The project
In this project, i use the [p5 library](https://p5js.org/) to run the neural network on browser. To run the neural network, just open the `index.html` file inside `p5/lib/neural-network`.

Basically, we have some matrix and weights, and all the data flows like input->hidden->output.

I made this project watching the [Computeiro videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfvgl3pGWxGnPkXDB5hS5bAryMGZ0TU5k).
